                        What started off as a convienient way to unlock a new skin in a game without spending countless hours grinding,
                        has now become the straw that broke the camels back. Gamers are outraged at how microtransactions has been implemented
                        in recent games from the big publishers EA, Activision, Blizzard etc... Gamers has continuously seen the successors of

                        if you have enough money just pay for the best weapons, the best powerups and easily cruise your way to victory while the
                        broke haters just can't admit how much better you are than them.
